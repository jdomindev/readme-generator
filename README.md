# README-Generator
## Description
- This project is a README generator.
- Its function is to take in a user's answers to prompts, and then use those answers to dynamically create a markdown page for a readme.
- While making this project I learned how to use node.js modules, like inquirer and file system, to take in user inputs in the terminal and then use that data in functions that I created.
- The inquirer module was used to prompt the user and collect the answers, while the fs module was used to write to file the template literals, that held the answers, along with additional markdown language.
